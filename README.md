# ECE 6780 - Embedded Systems Design

This course is an intensive exploration of the principles and practices that underpin modern embedded systems. It is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, build, and program embedded systems, with a particular focus on ARM Cortex-M0 processors and related hardware.

## Course Description


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be proficient in:

- **Designing Printed-Circuit Boards (PCBs):** From schematic design to manufacturing, using both through-holes and surface-mount devices.
- **Understanding ARM Cortex Processors:** Gaining insights into assembly, core architecture, and memory systems.
- **Writing Firmware:** Developing software in C for ARM Cortex-M0-based systems.
- **Utilizing Micro-controller Peripherals:** Working with GPIOs, Interrupt managers, Timers, and more.
- **Implementing Communication Protocols:** Using UART, I2C, SPI, among others.
- **Interfacing with Sensors and Actuators:** Through analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog peripherals.
- **Cyber-Physical Systems Modeling:** Learning state-of-the-art techniques for modeling cyber-physical systems.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems:** Understanding the mechanics and implementation of real-time operating systems.
- **Project Implementation:** Executing a complete embedded system project from specifications to final testing.
