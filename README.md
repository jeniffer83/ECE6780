# ECE 6780 - Embedded Systems Design

## Course Description
This class focuses on modern embedded systems design. It will focus on computer architecture, fundamentals of hardware/software interface, and techniques for sensing and controlling the physical world. The labs will focus on the ARM Cortex-MO and others supporting hardware to learn how to design, build, and program embedded systems.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Be able to design a PCB (printed circuit board) using through-holes and surface mounts.
2. Understand the basics of ARM Cortex processors.
3. Be able to write firmware (in C) for ARM Cortex-MO based embedded systems.
4. Utilize a basic set of microcontrollers peripherals.
5. Use multiple communication protocols.
6. Interface microcontrollers with sensors and actuators using analog-to-digital peripherals and vice versa.
7. Understand new cyber-physical systems and modeling techniques.
8. Learn mechanics of real-time operating systems.
9. Create a complete embedded systems based on specifications for a final testing through a project.
